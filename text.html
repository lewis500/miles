    Which of these two trades would save more gas?
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Trading a sedan that gets 28 mpg (miles per gallon) for a compact car that gets 38 mpg.</li>
            <li>Trading an S.U.V. that gets 15 mpg for a lighter one that gets 20 mpg.</li>
        </ol>

    Of course, <b>a</b> <em>seems</em> like the right answer, but let's check the math. <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm">The average American</a> drives about 13,500 miles per year. How many gallons per year will the average American save with each swap?</p>

        \[  \begin{aligned}
          \textbf{a.} & \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{28 \, mpg} - \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{38 \, mpg} = 482 \, gal. - 355 \, gal. = 127 \, gal.\\
          \textbf{b.} & \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{15 \, mpg} - \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{20 \, mpg} = 900 \, gal. - 675 \, gal.= 225 \, gal.\\
          \end{aligned}
        \]    

    <b>b</b> saves nearly twice as much gas! If you called this wrong, you're not alone. A 2008 <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/320/5883/1593?ijkey=3pScQm7pQBzqs&keytype=ref&siteid=sci">study</a> published in Science by <a href='http://sites.duke.edu/larrick/'>Richard Larrick</a> and <a href="http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty_research/faculty_directory/soll/">Jack Soll</a>, professors at Duke University's Fuqua School of Management, suggests "there is a systematic misperception in judging fuel efficiency when it is expressed as miles per gallon."  Namely, most people think gas usage falls <em>linearly</em> as mpg rises, when the actual relationship is <em>curved</em>: an extra mpg makes less of a difference to the consumption of efficient vehicles than to inefficient ones. They call this effect "<a href="http://www.mpgillusion.com/">The MPG Illusion</a>."

    You might say: "That's because going from 15 to 20 is a bigger <em>percentage</em> jump than going from 28 to 38!" But the misperception persists even when you compare proportions. The chart below shows the savings from a 50% boost in mpg. The more mpg the vehicle starts out with, the less gas a 50% boost saves.

  <h3>Gallons per Hundred Miles</h3>

  The problem is that mpg is a fraction with miles in the numerator and gallons in the denominator. It's convenient for questions with answers expressed in miles, such as: "If my car has 5 gallons left in the tank, and it gets 30 miles per gallon, how many miles can I go without stopping for gas?"

  \[  
    \frac{30 \, mi.}{1 \, gal.} * 3 \, gal. = 150 \, mi.
  \] 

  More often, however, you want answers expressed in gallons. Gallons are what matter to your budget and the environment (100 gallons <a href="http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=307&t=11">emits one ton</a> of CO2). Therefore, it makes sense to put gallons in the numerator. A direct way would be to flip mpg and use <b>gallons per mile</b>:

  \[  
    \frac{1}{25 \, mi./gal.} = \frac{.04 \, gal. }{1\,mi.} 
  \]   

  But you'd have say, "point zero..." a bunch of times. A better way is to use gallons per hundred miles (gphm):

  \[  
    \frac{.04 \, gal.}{1 mi.} * \frac{100 \,mi.}{100\,mi.} = \frac{4 \, gal. }{100 \,mi.} = 4 \, gphm
  \] 

  When you put gallons in the numerator, comparing fuel usage is easy. The chart below shows how a 1 gphm drop <i>always</i> saves the same amount of gasoline.<br>

  <h3>Policy Implications</h3>

  Does all this mean it's alright to buy a new gas guzzler as long as it's even <i>slightly</i> more efficient than your old one? Just the opposite. If you're upgrading from 14 to 18 mpg, you're still in the range where each mpg saves lots of gas, and you can cut your usage 28% by reaching for a 25 mpg sedan instead. That's why Larrick and Soll argue, "removing the most inefficient vehicles is where policy and popular opinion should be focused." In other words, it's more important to nudge drivers from gas guzzlers to normal cars than from normal cars to hybrids.<br>

  Fortunately, the government has already taken steps to steer the conversation. In the 2009 best-seller <i>Nudge</i>, U. Chicago economists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler discussed "The MPG Illusion" at length, and when President Obama appointed Sunstein to run the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Sunstein worked to include "gallons per 100 miles" on vehicle showroom stickers that came out this year.
