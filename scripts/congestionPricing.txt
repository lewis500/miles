equity arguments on road pricing are absurd

on principle: we don't worry about pricing anything else, even plenty of things involved in transportation.

in practice: none of the analyses account for the massive costs that cars impose on buses, which are the mode of choice for the poor. we enormously underestimate the damage, because buses are subject to feedback loops both in operation and demand.

Now that De Blasio is taking the helm in NYC, it looks like some very dilluted version of congestion pricing is back on the table. Leaders and voters are already speaking out what is widely perceived as an unfair and regressive proposal. But the equity arguments surrounding congestion pricing are absurd in principle and in practice.

First, in principle. Pricing is like dancing: our society pulls it off constantly without much ado, but if we have to make a deliverate decision to price something, the whole idea of charging money to use a scarce resource seems wildly unfair. Why should the rich be able to drive around the street of Manhattan with abandon? Various commentators have called up images of rich people just cruising relentlessly in Ferraris. 

This objection is so stupid it nauseates me. Everyone is fine with prices for cars, gas, tires, car insurance, buses, parking structures, and trains...virtually every aspect of the transportation experience except for driving on the road. Actually, scratch that, we do price driving on the road through gas taxes, although this method is fortunately not obvious enough for people to think it's unfair.

The response of the planning community has been to coordinate endless and exhaustive studies of the equity impacts, trying to break down exactly who would pay how much. I say this is absurd.
