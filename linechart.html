    Which of these two trades would save more gas?
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Trading a sedan that gets 28 mpg for a compact car that gets 38 mpg.</li>
            <li>Trading an S.U.V. that gets 15 mpg for a lighter one that gets 20 mpg.</li>
        </ol>

    Of course, <b>a</b> <em>seems</em> like the right answer. It's a 10 mpg increase, while <b>b</b> only bumps up the gas mileage by 5 mpg. But let's check the math. The average American drives about 13,500 miles per year. How many gallons per year will the average American save with each swap?</p>

        \[  \begin{aligned}
          \textbf{a.} & \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{28 \, mpg} - \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{38 \, mpg} = 482 \, gal. - 355 \, gal. = 127 \, gal.\\
          \textbf{b.} & \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{15 \, mpg} - \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{20 \, mpg} = 900 \, gal. - 675 \, gal.= 225 \, gal.\\
          \end{aligned}
        \]    

    <b>b</b> saves nearly twice as much gas! It turns out that an extra mile per gallon makes less of a difference to efficient cars than to inefficient ones.  The chart below shows how many gallons of gas per year an average driver would save by switching to a car that gets 10 more mpg. Drag the slider to control how many mpg the driver's current car gets. The higher the mpg of your current car, the less of a difference an extra 10 mpg makes in your annual gasoline consumption.

    <div id="lineChart"></div>
    <div id="slider"></div>

  </div>

  <div id="percent" >

    Now, you might think:

    <blockquote>
      That's because going from 15 to 20 is a bigger <em>percentage</em> jump than going from 28 to 38!
    </blockquote>

    So let's try the choice again. Which of these two swaps would save more gallons of gasoline?
      <ol type="a">
          <li>Trading a sedan that gets 25 mpg for a hybrid that gets 50 mpg.</li>
          <li>Trading an old S.U.V. that gets 12 mpg for a newer one that gets 16 mpg.</li>
      </ol>

    No matter how you look at it, <b>a</b> seems like the right answer. In absolute terms, <b>a</b>'s 25 mile per gallon increase is over six times larger than <b>b</b>'s 4 mpg bump. In percentage terms, <b>a</b> represents a 100% increase in mpg, while <b>b</b> gets you just 25% more. 

    To make sure, let's do the math. The average American drives about 13,500 miles per year. How many gallons per year will the average American save with each swap?</p>

    \[  \begin{aligned}
      \textbf{a.} & \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{25 \, mpg} - \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{50 \, mpg} = 540 \, gal. - 270 \, gal. = 200 \, gal.\\
      \textbf{b.} & \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{12 \, mpg} - \frac{13,500 \, mi.}{16 \, mpg} = 1,125 \, gal. - 844 \, gal.= 281 \, gal.\\
      \end{aligned}
    \]
        
    It turns out that <b>b</b> saves 81 more gallons per year than <b>a</b>!  How can this be? Well, <b>a</b> reduces gasoline consumption by half, and <b>b</b> reduces it by one third. But one half of a small number is less than one third of a large number.
