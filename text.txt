When you buy eggs, you don't usually ask, "How many eggs can I get with a dollar?" Instead you ask, "How many dollars does it take to buy a dozen eggs?"

When you buy a car, though, you ask something like the former question: "How many miles can I get with a gallon of gasoline?" This question might be useful if you needed to know how far the car can go on a full tank. But chances are that what you really want to know is, "How many gallons does it take to get me where I'm going?"
