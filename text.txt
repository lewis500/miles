When you buy eggs, you don't usually ask, "How many eggs can I get with a dollar?" Instead you ask, "How many dollars does it take to buy a dozen eggs?" 

When you think about the fuel efficiency of a car, you ask, "How many miles can I drive with a gallon of gasoline?" But usually what you're interested in is, "How many gallons of gasoline will this car consume?" It turns out that comparing the miles-per-gallon of two cars is deceptive, and people make better decisions when they use a different metric: "Gallons per mile."


Miles per gallon might be useful if you needed to know how far a car can go without refueling. For example, if a tank holds 10 gallons, and you know it gets 25 miles per gallon, then you can know the car will be able to drive 250 miles without stopping for gas. But chances are that what you really want to know is, "How many gallons does it take to get me where I'm going?"
