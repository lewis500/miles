Suppose you're trading in your car for one with better gas mileage. Which of these two swaps would save more gallons of gasoline?

a) Trading a sedan that gets 25 miles per gallon for a hybrid that gets 50 miles per gallon.

b) Trading an old S.U.V. that gets 12 miles per gallon for a newer one that gets 16 miles per gallon.

No matter how you look at it, (a) seems like the right answer. In absolute terms, (a)'s 25 mile per gallon increase is over six times larger than (b)'s 4 mpg bump. In percentage terms, (a) represents a 100% increase in miles per gallon, while (b) gets you just 25% more. Surprisingly enough, though, (b) is the correct answer. 

Let's do the math. The average American drives about 13,500 miles per year.

(a) really does reduce gasoline consumption by 50%, but that's 50% of a relatively small number. In the (b) swap, you start out using so many gallons that even a small percentage increase makes a big difference.

The problem is that miles per gallon is a fraction with miles in the numerator and gallons in the denominator. This arrangement is convenient for answering questions in which the number of gallons used is fixed. For example, if the tank holds 10 gallons, and you know it gets 25 miles per gallon, then it's easy to figure out that the car can go 250 miles without stopping for gas. But chances are that it's your number of miles, not your number of gallons, that's fixed. You're more interested in asking, "How many gallons will this car need for all my driving?" For this question, it would help to put gallons in the denominator. 

According to Richard Larrick and Jack Soll, professors at Duke's Fuqua School of Business, people tend to believe that fuel consumption falls at a steady rate as miles per gallon increases. 

Instead, Larrick and Soll reccommend an alternative metric: gallons per 100 miles.
